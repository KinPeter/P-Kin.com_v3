### Features:

- **Introduction + Portfolio -**
Visitors can read about me, my skills, interests, also check out my developer portfolio in three different categories.

- **Exploiting Markdown -**
Most of the textual content is saved on the server using Markdown syntax, and then parsed on the frontend, thus reducing the necessary HTML in the code itself.  

- **Internationalization (i18n) -**
The UI and most of the contents are available in three different languages, and it is possible to switch between them at any time without reloading the page. I used the `ngx-translate` library for the i18n implementation.

- **Dark and light themes -**
Also switching between the light and dark theme is possible without any glitch thanks to the flexibility of CSS variables.

### Technologies used:

- Angular 13
- TypeScript
- CSS3 + SCSS
- Markdown
