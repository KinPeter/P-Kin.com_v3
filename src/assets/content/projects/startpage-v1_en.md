![Startpage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KinPeter/StartPage/master/screenshot.jpg)

This one is from the early days when I started to learn web development.

I got a bit bored of always looking for my favorite bookmarks and of going to different sites to take notes or search for something, so I created an all-in-one startpage for myself.

### Functionalities:
- **Welcoming** with location info and weather forecast
- **Notes -** basic CRUD with data in MySQL database
- **Link tiles -** all my important and favorite links in one place
- **Search box -** search in my bookmarks, Korean dictionary, or Google
- **Daily Korean -** shows three cards with random Korean words from my word list

### Technologies used:
- JQuery
- Bootstrap
- CSS
- PHP
- MySQL
