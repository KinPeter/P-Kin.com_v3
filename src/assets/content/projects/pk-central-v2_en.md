A Python rewrite of the previous Node.JS based PK-Central API to explore the world of Python.

### Features:
* Authentication supporting both password and email based login with JWT
* Endpoints for CRUD operations for several types of data stored in a MongoDB database
* Proxy endpoints collecting data from third party APIs
* Gemini AI integration
* Full data backup service

### Technologies used:
* Python
* FastAPI
* MongoDB database
* Docker & Docker Compose
* DigitalOcean Droplet for hosting
* CI/CD with GitHub workflows and git hooks
* pytest for unit testing
* FastAPI's built-in test client for API acceptance testing
