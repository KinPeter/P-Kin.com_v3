Demo application for how to create and use a zoomable, filterable, interactive map of basically any random images.

The idea and most of the implementation came from an official project where I had to create a similar map from scratch. For this demonstration I chose to use Google's Material Icons since their number is over 2000, and it is also possible to apply filters for them by categories.
