My old, first homepage at [old.p-kin.com](https://old.p-kin.com) (Just to keep there for nostalgy...)

### Features:
- **Responsive design -**
It's fully responsive thanks to Bootstrap, so it should look fine on both desktops, tablets and mobile phones.

- **Animated elements -**
To make the site a bit more dynamic, I added some animations using both Bootstrap and jQuery.

- **Contact form -**
If you want to send a message to me there is a contact form available at the bottom using the mail functions of PHP.

- **Generating content from the server and from a database -**
Thanks to AJAX calls some of the content is generated by fetching data from MySQL database or from text files on the server.

### Technologies used:
- SCSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- JQuery
- PHP
- MySQL
