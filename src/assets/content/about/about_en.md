# Hello!
## I'm Peter,

After 10+ years in the tourism industry I decided to make a career change and since 2018 I've dedicated myself to programming.

I'm working as a **frontend web developer**, but when my time allows I like to create all kinds of applications from full stack web apps, CLI tools, or tinkering with my new hobby: game development.  

## Tasks I enjoy the most at work
- Working with **Angular** and **TypeScript**
- Using **modern JavaScript** features
- Building larger scale, robust applications

## Besides the job I like to
- Have fun with side projects
- Automating stuff, creating scripts, CLI tools
- Discovering new programming languages, frameworks
 
## Current goals
- Dive deeper into **Angular** and **Vue**
- Learn some backend 
- Discover **Unity with C#**
