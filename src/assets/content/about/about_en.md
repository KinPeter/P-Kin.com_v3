# Hello!
## I'm Peter,

After 10+ years in the tourism industry I decided to make a career change and since 2018 I've dedicated myself to programming.

I'm working as a **full-stack web developer** with stronger focus on the **frontend**, utilizing mostly modern UI frameworks like React, Angular or Vue with TypeScript. When my time allows I like to create all kinds of applications from full stack web apps, to CLI tools, or tinkering with Linux.  

## Tasks I enjoy the most at work
- Working with **React** or **Angular** with **TypeScript**
- Using **modern JavaScript** features
- Building larger scale, robust applications

## Besides the job I like to
- Have fun with side projects
- Automate stuff, creating scripts, CLI tools
- Tinkering with Linux, cloud and server stuff
 
## Current goals
- Learn more about backend with **NestJS** and databases
- Discover DevOps, CI/CD workflows
