# Hello!
## I'm Peter,

After 10+ years in the tourism industry I decided to make a career change and since 2018 I've dedicated myself to programming.

I'm working as a **senior software engineer** with stronger focus on the **frontend**, utilizing mostly modern web frameworks like Angular, React or Vue with TypeScript. On the server side my preferred techs are **Python** or **NodeJS**. When my time allows I like to create all kinds of applications from full stack web apps, to CLI tools, or tinkering with Linux.  

## Tasks I enjoy the most at work
- Working with **Angular** or **React** with **TypeScript**
- Using **modern JavaScript** features
- Creating APIs and scripts with **Python**
- Building larger scale, robust applications

## Besides the job I like to
- Have fun with side projects
- Automate stuff, creating scripts, CLI tools
- Tinkering with Linux, cloud and server stuff
 
## Current goals
- Maximize AI utilization as a tool for my work and projects
- Perfect my knowledge in Web Accessibility (A11y)
- Dive deeper into **Python** and its ecosystem
- Learn more about backend services and databases
- Discover DevOps, CI/CD workflows
